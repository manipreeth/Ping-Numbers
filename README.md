# Ping Numbers

Ping Numbers is a collection of calculators designed to perform various calculations related to integers, BMI (Body Mass Index), simple interest, compound interest, and age. The project includes four calculators: Integer Calculator, BMI Calculator, Interest Calculator, and Age Calculator. Each calculator offers unique functionality to cater to different calculation needs.

## Integer Calculator 🧮

The Integer Calculator allows you to perform advanced operations with integers, example `-2 * -2`. This calculator provides a convenient way to perform complex integer calculations.

## BMI Calculator 📏💪

The BMI Calculator helps you determine your Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of body fat based on your height and weight. It allows you to input your height and weight and provides an accurate BMI calculation along with an interpretation of the results.

## Interest Calculator 💰🔢

The Interest Calculator allows you to calculate simple interest. It takes inputs such as principal amount, interest rate, and time period, and computes the total interest accrued over the given time period.

## Age Calculator 🎂⏳

The Age Calculator helps you calculate the age based on the date of birth provided. It takes a date of birth input and calculates the current age, considering the current date.
